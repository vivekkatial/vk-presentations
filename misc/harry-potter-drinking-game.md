## Take a Sip Every Time...
1. Someone says "Harry Potter." Careful, he is famous, so his name gets thrown around a lot.
2. Ron looks confused.
3. Someone says the word 'Muggle.' Nasty context not necessary.
4. Points are awarded or taken, from all the Houses. 
5. A ghost floats by. Add extra sips if Nearly Headless Nick.
6. Hermione reads a book or answers a question in class. 
7. At least one member of the trio is in the Great Hall, which tends to be for meals. Ron is a hungry boy.
8. Closest character look-alike casts a spell each time their counter-part casts  a spell -- everyone must drink atleast one sip. If this person fails to cast the spell, other members my "stupefy" them causing them to drink twice.

## Take two sips
1. Harry's scar hurts, which happens way more than you think. Get drinking.
2. Harry catches the Snitch â€” 160 points to Gryffindor!
3. A significant cast member dies. RIP Sirius, Lupin, Fred, and all the ones who I curse JK Rowling for killing off.


## Take three sips
1. Voldemort is mentioned by name, not whatever crazy way a wizard tries to get around saying the actual name.
2. The Weasley twins speak in unison.
3. Something pretty unfortunate happens to Neville. Think: being petrified, locked out of the common room, being caught trying to warn Harry, etc...

## Finish half your drink
1. Malfoy says, "My father will hear about this," emphatically while walking away from Harry or some other problem he has caused. 
2. When someone tells Harry that he has his mothers eyes. The comparison to his fathers hair can be used interchangeably.
