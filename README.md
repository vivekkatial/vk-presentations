## (Last Updated Apr 2022)

I’ve been a Data Scientist since 2016 and have worked with a few tech-startups and NFPs. I’m now working at [Multitudes](https://www.multitudes.co) as a Data Scientist, Exec Director at the [Good Data Institute](https://www.gooddatainstitute.com). I am also in the entangled in doing a **PhD** in Quantum Computing and Optimisation. Why do I do this to myself? I have no clue 

This repository contains slides and demo-stuff used in talks given by me.
