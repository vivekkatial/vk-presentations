# Research Platforms Services - GitHub Workshop

This repository is associated with the workshop for Git/Github I am running through Research Platform Services at the University of Melbourne.

Github is one of the power tools of programming. It allows you to keep track of what you did and when you did it, you can undo any changes you decide and it also collaborates at scale with other people.

This tutorial will be a gentle introduction to Git and Github, a modern version control tool that is very popular with data scientists and software developers. 

We will show you how to use it to get more done in less time and with less pain!
