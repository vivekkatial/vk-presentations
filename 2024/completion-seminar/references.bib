To date, classical heuristics have consistently outperformed quantum-annealing based approaches. Here we introduce a class of problems based on frustrated cluster loops - deceptive cluster loops - for which all currently known state-of-the-art classical heuristics are outperformed by the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing machine. While there is a sizable constant speedup over all known classical heuristics, a noticeable improvement in the scaling remains elusive. These results represent the first steps towards a detection of potential quantum speedup, albeit without a scaling improvement and for synthetic benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a programmable quantum annealing machine has been built that minimizes the cost function of hard optimization problems by adiabatically quenching quantum fluctuations. Tests performed by different research teams have shown that, indeed, the machine seems to exploit quantum effects. However experiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an advantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer hardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These engineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a decohering thermal bath. Therefore, we study the finite-temperature critical behavior of the standard benchmark problem used to assess the computational capabilities of these complex machines. We simulate both random-bond Ising models and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave Chimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of finding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not polynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin glasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that benchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might not be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose alternative benchmarks by embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera topology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant) disorder-temperature phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show that a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)% antiferromagnetic bonds. Beyond this threshold the system only displays a zero-temperature spin-glass phase. Our results therefore show that a careful design of the hardware architecture and benchmark problems is key when building quantum annealing machines.},

In this paper we describe how we can mimic a finite domain propagation engine, by mapping propagators into clauses in a SAT solver. This immediately results in strong nogoods for finite domain propagation. But a naive static translation is impractical except in limited cases. We show how we can convert propagators to lazy clause generators for a SAT solver. The resulting system can solve scheduling problems significantly faster than generating the clauses from scratch, or using Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers with difference logic.",

Abstract = {This article presents a method for the objective assessment of an algorithm's strengths and weaknesses. Instead of examining the performance of only one or more algorithms on a benchmark set or generating custom problems that maximize the performance difference between two algorithms, ourmethod quantifies both the nature of the test instances and the algorithm performance. Our aim is to gather information about possible phase transitions in performance, that is, the points in which a small change in problem structure produces algorithm failure. The method is based on the accurate estimation and characterization of the algorithm footprints, that is, the regions of instance space in which good or exceptional performance is expected from an algorithm. A footprint can be estimated for each algorithm and for the overall portfolio. Therefore, we select a set of features to generate a common instance space,which we validate by constructing a sufficiently accurate prediction model. We charact},

With the number of steps growing only as the cube of the number of variables, the adiabatic method gives solution probabilities close to 1 for problem sizes feasible to evaluate via simulation on current computers. However, for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly large, so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps. Moreover, the resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods. Variants of the quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs, on average, and slower growth than the conventional GSAT heuristic method.},

In addition, we construct a simple classical translationally invariant one-dimensional Hamiltonian containing nearest-neighbour interactions only, which exhibits an exponential gap at a thermodynamic quantum first-order transition of essentially topological origin.

abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to be better at solving certain computational problems than classical computers. This expectation is based on (well-founded) conjectures in computational complexity theory, but rigorous comparisons between the capabilities of quantum and classical algorithms are difficult to perform. Bravyi et al. proved theoretically that whereas the number of “steps” needed by parallel quantum circuits to solve certain linear algebra problems was independent of the problem size, this number grew logarithmically with size for analogous classical circuits (see the Perspective by Montanaro). This so-called quantum advantage stems from the quantum correlations present in quantum circuits that cannot be reproduced in analogous classical circuits. Science, this issue p. 308; see also p. 289 Parallel quantum circuits outperform classical counterparts at solving certain linear algebra problems. Quantum effects can enhance information-processing capabilities and speed up the solution of certain computational problems. Whether a quantum advantage can be rigorously proven in some setting or demonstrated experimentally using near-term devices is the subject of active debate. We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality. The proposed quantum algorithm is a suitable candidate for near-future experimental realizations, as it requires only constant-depth quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor gates on a two-dimensional grid of qubits (quantum bits).}}

abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has numerous promising applications in solving the combinatorial optimization problems on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scalable Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAOA has a quantum-classical hybrid structure. Its quantum part consists of a parameterized alternating operator ansatz, and its classical part comprises an optimization algorithm, which optimizes the parameters to maximize the expectation value of the problem Hamiltonian. This expectation value depends highly on the parameters, this implies that a set of good parameters leads to an accurate solution. However, at large circuit depth of QAOA, it is difficult to achieve global optimization due to the multiple occurrences of local minima or maxima. In this paper, we propose a parameters fixing strategy which gives high approximation ratio on average, even at large circuit depths, by initializing QAOA with the optimal parameters obtained from the previous depths. We test our strategy on the Max-cut problem of certain classes of graphs such as the 3-regular graphs and the Erdös-Rényi graphs.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

abstract="A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

@article{Munoz2021,
	abstract = {The inherent difficulty of solving a continuous, static, bound-constrained and single-objective black-box optimization problem depends on the characteristics of the problem's fitness landscape and the algorithm being used. Exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) uses numerical features generated via a sampling process of the search space to describe such characteristics. Despite their success in a number of applications, these features have limitations related with the computational costs associated with generating accurate results. Consequently, only approximations are available in practice which may be unreliable, leading to systemic errors. The overarching aim of this paper is to evaluate the reliability of five well-known ELA feature sets across multiple dimensions and sample sizes. For this purpose, we propose a comprehensive experimental methodology combining exploratory and statistical validation stages, which uses resampling techniques to minimize the sampling cost, and statistical significance tests to identify strengths and weaknesses of individual features. The data resulting from the methodology is collected and made available in the LEarning and OPtimization Archive of Research Data v1.0. The results show that instances of the same function can have feature values that are significantly different; hence, non-generalizable across instances, due to the effects produced by the boundary constraints. In addition, some landscape features under evaluation are highly volatile, and strongly susceptible to changes in sample size. Finally, the results show evidence of a curse of modality, meaning that the sample size should increase with the number of local optima.},

	abstract = {The theoretical and practical aspects and results of simulations based on a specialized tool that is used in the energy industry were adressed. The previously discussed cases in the literature by taking into account the worst case and critical states of networks in terms of complex networks were extended. Using the Monte-Carlo method, the vulnerability of the power grid to node failures was investigated, both in terms of the use of specialized software, which is used in the power industry, and a tool for the analysis of complex networks graphs. We present the results obtained and the observed analogy between the results of the analysis performed in specialized software and the complex network graph analysis tool. It has been shown that the results obtained coincide for both software packages, even though their application focuses on slightly different aspects of system operation. Moreover, further possibilities of extending the research in this direction are proposed, taking into account not only the improvement of the method used, but also a significant increase in the size of the tested structure model.},

abstract = {Social commerce is an emerging trend in which online shops create referral hyperlinks to other shops in the same online marketplace. We study the evolution of a social commerce network in a large online marketplace. Our dataset starts before the birth of the network (at which points shops were not linked to each other) and includes the birth of the network. The network under study exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution. We empirically compare a set of edge formation mechanisms (including preferential attachment and triadic closure) that may explain the emergence of this property. Our results suggest that the evolution of the network and the emergence of its power-law degree distribution are better explained by a network evolution mechanism that relies on vertex attributes that are not based on the structure of the network. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the power-law degree distribution emerges because shops prefer to connect to shops with more diverse assortments, and assortment diversity follows a power-law distribution. Shops with more diverse assortments are more attractive to link to because they are more likely to bring traffic from consumers browsing the WWW. Therefore, our results also imply that social commerce networks should not be studied in isolation, but rather in the context of the broader network in which they are embedded (the WWW).}

@article{Watts1998,
	abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1,2,3,4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8,9,10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired'to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world'networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Given that statistical properties or features of a dataset affect the difficulty of an instance for particular classification algorithms, we examine the diversity and quality of the UCI repository of test instances used by most machine learning researchers. We show how an instance space can be visualized, with each classification dataset represented as a point in the space. The instance space is constructed to reveal pockets of hard and easy instances, and enables the strengths and weaknesses of individual classifiers to be identified. Finally, we propose a methodology to generate new test instances with the aim of enriching the diversity of the instance space, enabling potentially greater insights than can be afforded by the current UCI repository.},

    abstract = "{This article presents a method to generate diverse and challenging new test instances for continuous black-box optimization. Each instance is represented as a feature vector of exploratory landscape analysis measures. By projecting the features into a two-dimensional instance space, the location of existing test instances can be visualized, and their similarities and differences revealed. New instances are generated through genetic programming which evolves functions with controllable characteristics. Convergence to selected target points in the instance space is used to drive the evolutionary process, such that the new instances span the entire space more comprehensively. We demonstrate the method by generating two-dimensional functions to visualize its success, and ten-dimensional functions to test its scalability. We show that the method can recreate existing test functions when target points are co-located with existing functions, and can generate new functions with entirely different characteristics when target points are located in empty regions of the instance space. Moreover, we test the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art algorithms on the new set of instances. The results demonstrate that the new set is not only more diverse than a well-known benchmark set, but also more challenging for the tested algorithms. Hence, the method opens up a new avenue for developing test instances with controllable characteristics, necessary to expose the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms, and drive algorithm development.}",

The former problem comes up in solid-state physics, and the latter in very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) circuit design and in printed circuit board design. Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we eliminate the classical outer learning loop of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and present a strategy to find good parameters for QAOA based on topological arguments of the problem graph and tensor network techniques. Starting from the observation of the concentration of control parameters of QAOA, we find a way to classically infer parameters which scales polynomially in the number of qubits and exponentially with the depth of the circuit. Using this strategy, the quantum processing unit (QPU) is only needed to sample from the final state of QAOA. This method paves the way for a variation-free version of QAOA and makes QAOA more practical for applications on NISQ devices. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach for the initial assumptions and its resilience with respect to situations where they are not fulfilled. Moreover, we investigate the applicability of our method beyond the scope of QAOA, in improving schedules for quantum annealing.}

abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was proposed as a way of finding good, approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA uses a hybrid approach. A parametrized quantum state is repeatedly prepared and measured on a quantum computer to estimate its average energy. Then, a classical optimizer, running in a classical computer, uses such information to decide on the new parameters that are then provided to the quantum computer. This process is iterated until some convergence criteria are met. Theoretically, almost all classical minimizers can be used in the hybrid scheme. However, their behaviour can vary greatly in both the quality of the final solution and the time they take to find it. In this work, we study the performance of twelve different classical optimizers when used with QAOA to solve the maximum cut problem in graphs. We conduct a thorough set of tests on a quantum simulator both, with and without noise, and present results that show that some optimizers can be hundreds of times more efficient than others in some cases.}

Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.",

abstract = {A 2-prover game is called unique if the answer of one prover uniquely determines the answer of the second prover and vice versa (we implicitly assume games to be one round games). The value of a 2-prover game is the maximum acceptance probability of the verifier over all the prover strategies. We make the following conjecture regarding the power of unique 2-prover games, which we call the Unique Games Conjecture:(MATH) The Unique Games Conjecture: For arbitrarily small constants $  zeta,  delta > 0$, there exists a constant $k = k(zeta,delta)$ such that it is NP-hard to determine whether a unique 2-prover game with answers from a domain of size $k$ has value at least $1-zeta$ or at most $delta$. medskip.(MATH) We show that a positive resolution of this conjecture would imply the following hardness results:For any $frac{1}{2} < t < 1$, for all sufficiently small constants $epsilon > 0$, it is NP-hard to distinguish between the instances of the problem 2-Linear-Equations mod 2 where either there exists an assignment that satisfies $1-epsilon$ fraction of equations or no assignment can satisfy more than $1-epsilon^t$ fraction of equations. As a corollary of the above result, it is NP-hard to approximate the Min-2CNF-deletion problem within any constant factor.For the constraint satisfaction problem where every constraint is the predicate Not-all-equal($a,b,c$), $  a, b, c in GF(3)  $, it is NP-hard to distinguish between the instances where either there exists an assignment that satisfies $1-epsilon$ fraction of the constraints or no assignment satisfies more than $frac{8}{9}+epsilon$ fraction of the constraints for an arbitrarily small constant $epsilon > 0$. We also get a hardness result for a slight variation of approximate coloring of 3-uniform hypergraphs.(MATH) We also show that a variation of the Unique Games Conjecture implies that for arbitrarily small constant $delta > 0$ it is hard to find an independent set of size $delta n$ in a graph that is guaranteed to have an independent set of size $Omega(n)$.The main idea in all the above results is to use the 2-prover game given by the Unique Games Conjecture as an "outer verifier" and build new probabilistically checkable proof systems (PCPs) on top of it. The uniqueness property plays a crucial role in the analysis of these PCPs.(MATH) In light of such interesting consequences, we think it is an important open problem to prove (or disprove) the Unique Games Conjecture. We also present a semi-definite programming based algorithm for finding reasonable prover strategies for a unique 2-prover game. Given a unique 2-prover game with value $1-zeta$ and answers from a domain of size $k$, this algorithm finds prover strategies that make the verifier accept with probability $1-O(k^2 zeta^{1/5} sqrt{log (frac{1}{zeta})})$. This result shows that the domain size $k = k(zeta, delta)$ must be sufficiently large if the Unique Games Conjecture is true.},

We consider classical and newly-generated instances to test the performance of four mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. This is the first time ISA is used to compare MIP models. We set as a performance metric the time taken by the black-box MIP solver CPLEX to obtain a proven optimal solution when running each model. Our results provide a new perspective on the different models’ performance according to each instance’s features.}
