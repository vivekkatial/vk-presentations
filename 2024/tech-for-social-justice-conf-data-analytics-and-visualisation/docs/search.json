It’s a process that involves extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a database or data warehouse. This process is essential for data analytics because it allows you to gather data from different sources, clean and enrich it, and store it in a way that is easy to access and analyze.\nWe’ll dive into each of these steps in more detail in the next few slides, but the key takeaway is that ETL is a critical part of the data analytics process and is essential for turning raw data into actionable insights."

Try and keep it all automated as much as possible. Use tools that people know how to use and can be easily maintained.\nExamples for cleaning can include basic scripts in python or R, or using tools like Tableau. More advance tools like dbt can also be used for this.\nEnrichment – this involves adding contextual information to the data. This could be geocoding, demographic data, or other information that can help you better understand the data. This can be done using APIs or other data sources (like the ABS or the Department of Social Services). It could also be computing things – for example using different date fields to understand how long delivery of services is taking.\nAggregation – this involves creating summaries of the data that can be used for analysis or shared with stakeholders. This could be a summary of the number of people served, the amount of money raised, or other key metrics that are important to your organization. This can be done using tools like Tableau or Power BI or if you have an data pipeline; in tools like dbt/ AWS Step Functions.\nAn example of this would be a nonprofit that provides food to people experiencing homelessness. They could create a summary of the number of meals served, the number of people served, and other key metrics that are important to their organization. This summary could be shared with stakeholders to show the impact of their work. We did this with Lentils As Anything (who have no clsoed down)"

This could be in a data warehouse, a cloud storage solution, or another type of database. It’s important to ensure that the data is stored in a way that is easy to access and use for analysis. If you’re small think about using simple and scalable tools; we use Airtable for our data storage and it works well for us (in the scale of few hundred projects and few hundred volunteers).\nGovernance – this involves ensuring that data is used ethically and responsibly. This could include creating data policies, training staff on data ethics, and ensuring that data is used in a way that respects privacy and confidentiality. This is especially important for nonprofits that work with sensitive data or vulnerable populations.\nSecurity – this involves protecting data from unauthorized access or misuse. This could include using encryption, access controls, and other security measures to ensure that data is kept safe. It’s important to take data security seriously and to ensure that data is protected from cyber threats and other risks.

This makes the chart easier to read and understand.\nWe’ve reordered the countries by the number of projects. This makes it easier to see which countries have the most projects.\nWe’ve added labels to the x and y axes. This makes it clear what the chart is showing and how to interpret it.\n\nThese changes make the chart easier to read and understand, and help to communicate the data more effectively."

It’s easier to read and understand, and it communicates the data more effectively.\nBut there are still some things missing. What do you think is missing from both visualisations?\nWhat would happen if we had 40 countries here? Bar chart would be hard to read; Pie chart would be even harder to read.\nSo this is where using analytics to encode data into visual elements can help. In this case; we could geocode the data and plot it on a map."
